# multiProxies
Proxies scraped from spys.me and free-proxies-list.net

This little code will scrape 2 different proxy websites for the list of proxies, clean them and save them in a text file (which can be used as a proxy list).
Total proxies = 700

Whenever you run this script, it'll always get the updated proxies.
