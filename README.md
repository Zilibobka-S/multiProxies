# multiProxies
Proxies scraped from spys.me ~~and free-proxies-list.net~~

This little code will scrape proxy website for the list of proxies, find only google tested (according to spys.me, but often these proxies are dead, so there is a need to retest), clean them and save them in a text file (which can be used as a proxy list).

Whenever you run this script, it'll always get the updated proxies.

Feel free to add your own proxy websites with their respective codes.
